# Run bpfman From RPM

This section describes how to deploy `bpfman` from an RPM.
RPMs are generated each time a Pull Request is merged in github for Fedora 38, 39 and
Rawhide (see [Install Prebuilt RPM](#install-prebuilt-rpm) below).
RPMs can also be built locally from a Fedora server
(see [Build RPM Locally](#build-rpm-locally) below).

## Install Prebuilt RPM

This section describes how to install an RPM built automatically by the
[Packit Service](https://dashboard.packit.dev/projects/github.com/bpfman/bpfman).
The Packit Service builds RPMs for each Pull Request merged.

### Packit Service Prerequisites

To install an RPM generated by the Packit Service, the following packages need
to be installed:

`dnf` based OS:

```console
sudo dnf install -y dnf-plugins-core
sudo dnf copr enable @ebpf-sig/bpfman-next
```

### Install RPM From Packit Service

To load an RPM from a specific commit, find the commit from
[bpfman commits](https://github.com/bpfman/bpfman/commits/main/), and click on
the green check showing a given Pull Request was verified.
At the bottom of the list of checks are the RPM builds, click on the `details`,
and follow the Packit Dashboard link to the `Copr Build Results`.
Then install the given RPM:

```console
sudo dnf install -y bpfman-0.4.0~dev-1.20240117143006587102.main.191.gda44a71.fc38.x86_64
```

`bpfman` is now installed but not running.
To start `bpfman`:

```console
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable bpfman.socket
sudo systemctl start bpfman.socket
```

Verify `bpfman` is installed and running:

```console
$ sudo systemctl status bpfman.socket
● bpfman.socket - bpfman API Socket
     Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/bpfman.socket; enabled; preset: disabled)
     Active: active (listening) since Thu 2024-01-18 21:19:29 EST; 5s ago
   Triggers: ● bpfman.service
     Listen: /run/bpfman-sock/bpfman.sock (Stream)
     CGroup: /system.slice/bpfman.socket
:

$ sudo systemctl status bpfman.service
○ bpfman.service - Run bpfman as a service
     Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/bpfman.service; static)
    Drop-In: /usr/lib/systemd/system/service.d
             └─10-timeout-abort.conf
     Active: inactive (dead)
TriggeredBy: ● bpfman.socket
:

$ sudo bpfman list
 Program ID  Name  Type  Load Time

```

### Uninstall Given RPM

To determine the RPM that is currently loaded:

```console
$ sudo rpm -qa | grep bpfman
bpfman-0.4.0~dev-1.20240117143006587102.main.191.gda44a71.fc39.x86_64
```

To uninstall the RPM:

```console
sudo dnf erase -y bpfman-0.4.0~dev-1.20240117143006587102.main.191.gda44a71.fc39.x86_64

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

## Build RPM Locally

This section describes how to build and install an RPM locally.

### Local Build Prerequisites

To build locally, the following packages need to be installed:

`dnf` based OS:

```console
sudo dnf install packit
sudo dnf install cargo-rpm-macros
```

> NOTE: `cargo-rpm-macros` needs to be version 25 or higher.
> It appears this is only available on Fedora 37, 38, 39 and Rawhide at the moment.

### Build Locally

To build locally, run the following command:

```console
packit build locally
```

This will generate several RPMs in a `x86_64/` directory:

```console
$ ls x86_64/
bpfman-0.4.0~dev-1.20240118212420167308.<USERNAME>.rpm.socket.192.gb2ea1b9.fc39.x86_64.rpm
bpfman-debuginfo-0.4.0~dev-1.20240118212420167308.<USERNAME>.rpm.socket.192.gb2ea1b9.fc39.x86_64.rpm
bpfman-debugsource-0.4.0~dev-1.20240118212420167308.<USERNAME>.rpm.socket.192.gb2ea1b9.fc39.x86_64.rpm
```

### Install Local Build

Install the RPM:

```console
sudo rpm -i x86_64/bpfman-0.4.0~dev-1.20240118212420167308.<USERNAME>.rpm.socket.192.gb2ea1b9.fc39.x86_64.rpm
```

`bpfman` is now installed but not running.
To start `bpfman`:

```console
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable bpfman.socket
sudo systemctl start bpfman.socket
```

Verify `bpfman` is installed and running:

```console
$ sudo systemctl status bpfman.socket
● bpfman.socket - bpfman API Socket
     Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/bpfman.socket; enabled; preset: disabled)
     Active: active (listening) since Thu 2024-01-18 21:19:29 EST; 5s ago
   Triggers: ● bpfman.service
     Listen: /run/bpfman-sock/bpfman.sock (Stream)
     CGroup: /system.slice/bpfman.socket
:

$ sudo systemctl status bpfman.service
○ bpfman.service - Run bpfman as a service
     Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/bpfman.service; static)
    Drop-In: /usr/lib/systemd/system/service.d
             └─10-timeout-abort.conf
     Active: inactive (dead)
TriggeredBy: ● bpfman.socket
:

$ sudo bpfman list
 Program ID  Name  Type  Load Time

```

### Uninstall Local Build

To determine the RPM that is currently loaded:

```console
$ sudo rpm -qa | grep bpfman
bpfman-0.4.0~dev-1.20240118212420167308.<USERNAME>.rpm.socket.192.gb2ea1b9.fc39.x86_64
```

To uninstall the RPM:

```console
sudo rpm -e bpfman-0.4.0~dev-1.20240118212420167308.<USERNAME>.rpm.socket.192.gb2ea1b9.fc39.x86_64

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```
